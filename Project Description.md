### **Project Description: Advanced Recommendation System**

#### **Overview**
The **Advanced Recommendation System** is a web-based application designed to provide personalized item recommendations (e.g., products) to users. It leverages machine learning techniques, a scalable backend, and an interactive frontend to deliver accurate, user-friendly recommendations.

#### **Objective**
To create a system that:
1. Analyzes user preferences and behavior to recommend items dynamically.
2. Combines **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering** for accurate results.
3. Addresses challenges like cold-start problems and large-scale datasets.
4. Is modular, scalable, and deployable using modern technologies.

#### **Features**
1. **User Authentication**: Allows users to log in and save their preferences.
2. **Personalized Recommendations**: Displays suggestions based on user interactions.
3. **Dynamic UI**: Built with React.js (vite) for seamless interactivity.
4. **Real-Time Suggestions**: Updates recommendations based on user actions.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Allows users to rate or provide feedback to refine suggestions.
6. **Cold-Start Solutions**: Offers popular or trending items for new users.

#### **Technology Stack**
1. **Frontend**: React.js (vite) for a modern, interactive user interface.
2. **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for handling API requests and managing business logic.
3. **Machine Learning**: Python for building and serving ML models.
4. **Data Storage**: Preprocessed interaction matrix (or optional database like MongoDB/PostgreSQL).

#### **Dataset**
The system uses the **Amazon Reviews Dataset**, which includes user-item interaction data. I found Raw dataset of Amazon that contain: `product_id,product_name,category,discounted_price,actual_price,discount_percentage,rating,rating_count,about_product,user_id,user_name,review_id,review_title,review_content,img_link,product_link`

#### **System Workflow**
1. Users interact with the frontend application to explore and receive recommendations.
2. The React.js app communicates with the Node.js backend via RESTful APIs.
3. The backend requests recommendation data from a Python Flask service hosting the ML models.
4. Flask processes user-item interactions and generates personalized recommendations using advanced models like SVD or neural networks.
5. Recommendations are displayed dynamically on the frontend.

#### **Advanced Features**
- **Hybrid Recommendation Approach**: Combines collaborative filtering (e.g., SVD) with content-based filtering.
- **Neural Networks**: Optionally employs deep learning techniques (e.g., Autoencoders or Neural Collaborative Filtering) for large-scale datasets.

I am a student of B.Tech in Information Technology of final year. I have this project to make. I don't Know anything about this, I am new to this. So, I want you to tell me exactly what I have to do. For now, don't give codes. Tell Project Overview, Project Roadmap and Project Structure.
