### **Detailed Development Roadmap**  
This roadmap outlines a **6-phase approach** to building the recommendation system, prioritizing foundational components first, followed by scalability and advanced features.  

---

#### **Phase 1: Infrastructure & Data Pipeline (Weeks 1-2)**  
**Goals**:  
- Set up database and API skeleton.  
- Define data collection pipelines.  

**Tasks**:  
1. **Database Design**:  
   - Create PostgreSQL tables:  
     - `user_interactions` (user_id, event_type, product_id, query, timestamp).  
     - `products` (product_id, name, category, price, reviews, etc.).  
2. **FastAPI Setup**:  
   - Implement basic endpoints:  
     - `POST /interactions` (event logging).  
     - `GET /recommendations/home`, `/product/{product_id}`, `/search`.  
   - Add input validation using Pydantic.  
3. **Mock Data Generation**:  
   - Populate `products` table with synthetic data for testing.  
   - Simulate `user_interactions` for initial training.  

**Deliverables**:  
- Functional API with input validation.  
- PostgreSQL instance with sample data.

#### **Phase 2: Core ML Models (Weeks 3-4)**  
**Goals**:  
- Implement baseline recommendation algorithms.  

**Tasks**:  
1. **Content-Based Filtering**:  
   - Train TF-IDF model.
   - Generate embeddings for nearest-neighbor recommendations.  
2. **Collaborative Filtering**:  
   - Build user-item interaction matrix from `user_interactions`.  
   - Use matrix factorization (e.g., ALS) for personalized recommendations.  
3. **Trending Signals**:  
   - Calculate time-decayed popularity scores (e.g., `score = clicks / (1 + age_in_hours)`).  
4. **Association Rules**:  
   - Mine frequently co-clicked items using FP-Growth.  

**Deliverables**:  
- TF-IDF embeddings for product similarity.  
- Trending scores updated hourly.  
- Association rules (e.g., "users who clicked X also clicked Y").  

---

#### **Phase 3: Hybrid Recommendation Engine (Weeks 5-6)**  
**Goals**:  
- Merge signals from all models into final recommendations.  

**Tasks**:  
1. **Weighted Merging Logic**:  
   ```python  
   def hybrid_merge(clicked_recs, search_recs, trending_recs, diversity_recs):  
       merged = (  
           0.4 * clicked_recs +  # Collaborative  
           0.3 * search_recs +   # Query-based  
           0.2 * trending_recs + # Trending  
           0.1 * diversity_recs  # Random sampling  
       )  
       return rank(merged)  
   ```  
2. **Real-Time Personalization**:  
   - Fetch user’s last 30 days of interactions for collaborative filtering.  
3. **Edge Case Handling**:  
   - New users: Fallback to trending + best-value items.  
   - Stale profiles: Decay interaction weights after 30 days.  

**Deliverables**:  
- Unified recommendation API with hybrid merging.  
- Fallback mechanisms for edge cases.  

---

#### **Phase 4: Performance Optimization (Weeks 7-8)**  
**Goals**:  
- Achieve <150ms latency and 10k+ RPM scalability.  

**Tasks**:  
1. **Async Database Queries**:  
   - Use `asyncpg` for non-blocking PostgreSQL access.  
2. **Caching**:  
   - Cache trending/product recommendations with Redis (TTL = 1 hour).  
3. **Load Testing**:  
   - Simulate 10k RPM traffic using Locust.  
   - Optimize slow database queries (e.g., add indexes on `user_id`).  

**Deliverables**:  
- Latency <150ms under load.  
- Horizontal scaling via Kubernetes.  

---

#### **Phase 5: Advanced Features (Weeks 9-10)**  
**Goals**:  
- Enhance recommendation quality and usability.  

**Tasks**:  
1. **Query Expansion**:  
   - Use SentenceTransformers to expand search queries (e.g., "headphones" → "earbuds").  
2. **A/B Testing Framework**:  
   - Compare hybrid vs. content-based recommendations.  
3. **Monitoring**:  
   - Track API latency, error rates, and recommendation CTR (click-through rate).  

**Deliverables**:  
- Improved search relevance.  
- Metrics dashboard (Grafana/Prometheus).  

---

#### **Phase 6: Deployment & Maintenance (Ongoing)**  
**Goals**:  
- Ensure system reliability and freshness.  

**Tasks**:  
1. **Containerization**:  
   - Dockerize API and ML training jobs.  
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:  
   - Automate testing and deployment with GitHub Actions.  
3. **Model Retraining**:  
   - Schedule daily TF-IDF/FP-Growth retraining with Airflow.  

**Deliverables**:  
- Production-ready Docker images.  
- Scheduled model updates.

### **Key Dependencies & Risks**  
| **Dependency**               | **Risk Mitigation**                          |  
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|  
| Database scalability          | Use TimescaleDB for time-series interactions |  
| Model accuracy                | Validate with offline metrics (e.g., precision@k) |  
| Freshness of recommendations  | Hourly trending score updates                |  

---

### **Tools & Collaboration**  
- **Version Control**: GitHub (branching strategy: GitFlow).  
- **Task Tracking**: Jira/Notion for sprint planning.  
- **Documentation**: Swagger for API specs, Markdown for technical details.  

This roadmap balances rapid iteration with scalability, ensuring the system meets both technical and business requirements.
